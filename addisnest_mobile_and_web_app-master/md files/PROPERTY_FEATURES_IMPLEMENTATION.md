# Property Features Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of property features display in the property detail page.

## Overview

The property features section has been added to display amenities and special features of each property. This enhancement makes it easier for users to quickly scan and understand what amenities are available with a particular property.

## Implementation Details

1. **Feature Data Structure**: 
   - Property features are stored in a `features` object in the property data model
   - Each feature is represented as a key-value pair where the key is the feature name and the value is a boolean indicating its presence

2. **UI Implementation**:
   - Added a dedicated "Property Features" section below the property specifications grid
   - Each feature is displayed in a visually distinct card with an appropriate icon
   - Features are displayed in a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
   - Added conditional rendering to only show features that are marked as `true` in the data
   - Included a fallback message when no features are available

3. **Visual Design**:
   - Used a clean, modern design with subtle background colors to highlight each feature
   - Included appropriate emoji icons to visually represent each feature type
   - Maintained consistent styling with the rest of the property detail page

## Features Supported

The current implementation supports displaying the following property features:
- Parking Space
- Garage
- 24/7 Security
- CCTV Surveillance
- Gym/Fitness Center
- Swimming Pool

## Technical Notes

- The feature keys in the database use hyphens (e.g., `parking-space`), but the UI displays them in a user-friendly format
- The implementation correctly handles property data that may not have a features object or where the features object may be empty
- The grid layout is responsive and will adjust based on screen size, showing more columns on larger screens and fewer on mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the features section could include:
1. Adding more feature types as they become available in the database
2. Implementing custom icons for each feature type instead of emoji
3. Adding the ability to filter properties based on desired features
4. Enhancing the UI to provide additional details about each feature on hover or click
