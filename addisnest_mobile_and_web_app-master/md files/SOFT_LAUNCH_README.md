## Soft Launch Timeline

For best results, plan for a 3-4 week soft launch period:

- **Week 1**: Pre-launch preparation and initial deployment
- **Week 2**: First round of limited user testing (5-10 users)
- **Week 3**: Expand testing group (10-20 more users) and implement initial improvements
- **Week 4**: Final improvements and preparation for full launch

## Important Considerations

- **Password Protection**: The simplest way to limit access during soft launch is to enable password protection in Netlify.
- **Feedback Collection**: Set up a feedback form before inviting users (Google Forms, Typeform, etc.).
- **Testing Focus**: Be specific about what you want testers to evaluate to get the most valuable feedback.
- **Gradual Scaling**: Start with a small group of trusted users before expanding to a larger test group.

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during the soft launch process:

1. Check the Netlify deployment logs for errors
2. Review the DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for Netlify-specific troubleshooting
3. Refer to [Netlify's documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/) for platform-specific questions

## After Soft Launch

Once you've completed the soft launch process and are ready for full public launch:

1. Remove any access restrictions (password protection or beta subdomain)
2. Update your DNS settings if needed
3. Announce your full launch through appropriate channels
4. Continue monitoring site performance and user feedback

Good luck with your launch!
