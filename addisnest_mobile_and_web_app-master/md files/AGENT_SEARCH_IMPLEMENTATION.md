### 2. Agent Profile Page

Each agent has a detailed profile displaying:

- Contact options: Phone, Email, in-app chat
- Bio and experience: Years active, areas served

### 3. Agent Verification Badge

### 4. In-App Contact Options

Users can directly:
- Call the agent
- Email the agent
- Chat with the agent through the platform

2. **SearchAgent** (`src/components/find-agent/search-agent/sub-component/SearchAgent.jsx`)
   - Search form with filters for finding agents
   - Contains form elements for all filter criteria
   - Navigates to the agent list with selected filters as URL parameters

3. **FindAgentList** (`src/components/find-agent/find-agent-list/sub-component/FindAgentList.jsx`)
   - Displays the list of agents matching the search criteria
   - Includes filtering functionality and pagination
   - Shows agent cards with essential information
   - Allows viewing detailed agent profiles

4. **AgentDetailPopup** (`src/components/helper/AgentDetailPopup.jsx`)

### State Management

- **AgentSlice** (`src/Redux-store/Slices/AgentSlice.js`)
  - Redux slice for managing agent data
  - Includes actions for fetching agents, filtering, and selecting specific agents

### Routes

The feature is accessible via the following routes:

## Sample Data

The implementation currently uses sample agent data with the following fields:

In the production version, this would be replaced with data from the backend API.
