# Property Database Error Handling Fix

## Problem Description

The application was failing when it couldn't fetch property data from the database. This could happen due to:
1. Invalid MongoDB ID format
2. Property not found in the database
3. Database connection errors
4. View count update errors

These issues would cause the application to crash or return 404/500 error pages, providing a poor user experience.

## Solution Implemented

The fix modifies the `getPropertyById` method in the `propertyController.js` file to handle database errors gracefully by:

1. **Replacing Error Responses with Formatted Responses**:
   - Instead of using `sendError()` which throws exceptions, we now use `sendResponse()` with a structured error object
   - This allows the frontend to gracefully handle the error and display appropriate fallback content

2. **Implementing Error-Safe View Count Updates**:
   - Wrapped the view count increment in a try-catch block
   - Even if the view count update fails, the property data is still returned to the client

3. **Providing Structured Error Information**:
   - Each error response includes:
     - `success: false` flag
     - Descriptive error message
     - Error code (400, 404, 500)
     - `fallback: true` flag for database errors to signal the frontend to use fallback data

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Users will no longer see application crashes when viewing property details
   - The application will display fallback content instead of error pages

2. **Better Error Tracking**:
   - All errors are properly logged to the console
   - Error responses include specific information about what went wrong

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - The fix works with the existing frontend code that expects structured responses
   - The PropertyDetailSlice.js already has fallback logic that will be triggered by these error responses

## Testing

To test the fix, try accessing property details with:
1. An invalid MongoDB ID (not 24 hex characters)
2. A valid format ID that doesn't exist in the database
3. A valid ID during a database connection issue

The application should handle all these cases gracefully without crashing.
