# Property Image Submission Fix

## Issue Analysis
User reported that when uploading 7 images from the property list form, only 2 properties are passed to the database and one of them is broken.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Image Schema Mismatch
- **PropertyListForm** stores images as: `{url, caption, _id}`
- **Property Model** expects: `{url}` only
- **ChoosePropmotion** removes `_id` but keeps `caption` which isn't in the schema

### 2. Duplicate Prevention Logic
- PropertyController has duplicate prevention that checks for properties created within the last minute
- This might be preventing legitimate property submissions

### 3. Image Processing Issues
- Images are uploaded individually in PropertyListForm
- MediaPaths state management might have race conditions
- Image array processing in ChoosePropmotion might be losing images

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Update Property Model Schema
```javascript
images: [
  {
    url: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    },
    caption: {
      type: String,
      default: ''
    }
  }
]
```

### 2. Fix Image Processing in ChoosePropmotion
- Ensure all uploaded images are properly formatted
- Add validation for image array
- Improve error handling

### 3. Enhance PropertyController
- Improve duplicate detection logic
- Better image validation
- Enhanced error logging

### 4. Fix PropertyListForm Image Upload
- Improve MediaPaths state management
- Add better error handling for failed uploads
- Ensure all images are properly tracked

## Testing Steps
1. Upload multiple images (7+) in property form
2. Submit property with Basic plan
3. Verify all images are saved in database
4. Check property appears correctly in listings
5. Verify no duplicate properties are created
