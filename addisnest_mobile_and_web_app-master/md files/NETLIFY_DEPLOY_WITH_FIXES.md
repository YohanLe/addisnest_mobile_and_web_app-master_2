# Netlify Deployment with Dependency Fixes

This guide outlines the steps to commit the Netlify dependency fixes and deploy the updated code to ensure the serverless functions work correctly.

## Issue Summary
The Netlify deployment was failing because the serverless functions required dependencies that were not properly specified in the package.json files. We've fixed this by:

1. Adding missing dependencies to the root package.json
2. Creating a functions/package.json with all required dependencies
3. Updating netlify.toml build command to install functions dependencies during build
4. Creating deployment scripts to handle the process

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit Changes to Git

Run the provided script to commit all changes to the master branch:

```
.\commit-dependency-fixes.bat
```

This script will:
- Add the modified files to git
- Commit them with a descriptive message
- Push to the master branch

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

After committing the changes, deploy to Netlify using the deployment script:

```
.\deploy-netlify-with-fixes.bat
```

This script will:
- Install the missing dependencies in the root directory
- Install dependencies for serverless functions in the functions directory
- Build the application
- Create Netlify function bundles if needed
- Deploy to Netlify

### Manual Deployment Steps

If you prefer to manually deploy, follow these steps:

1. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git add package.json functions/package.json deploy-netlify-with-fixes.bat NETLIFY_DEPENDENCY_FIX.md
   git commit -m "Fix: Add missing dependencies for Netlify functions deployment"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install express-async-handler cors jsonwebtoken
   cd functions
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Build and deploy:
   ```
   npm run build
   npx netlify-cli deploy --prod
   ```

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:
1. The Netlify build completes without dependency errors
2. The serverless functions work correctly
3. The API endpoints respond as expected

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Netlify build logs for errors
2. Verify all dependencies are correctly listed in both package.json files
3. Ensure the functions directory is correctly configured in netlify.toml
