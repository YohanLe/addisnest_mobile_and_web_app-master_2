# Property Count API Fix Implementation

## Issue Description

The application was encountering a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to fetch property count data from the `/api/properties/count` endpoint. This error occurred because the route order in `server.js` was incorrect, causing the "count" to be treated as a MongoDB ID in the `getPropertyById` method.

Error logs showed:
```
GET /api/properties/count
getPropertyById called with ID: count
Invalid MongoDB ID format: count
GET /api/properties/count 500 4.658 ms - 61
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. In Express.js, route order matters. The more specific routes should be registered before the more general routes.
2. In the server.js file, the `/api/properties` route was registered before the `/api/properties/count` route:
   ```javascript
   app.use('/api/properties', routes.propertyRoutes);
   app.use('/api/properties/count', routes.propertyCountRoutes);
   ```
3. This caused requests to `/api/properties/count` to be handled by the `/api/properties/:id` route handler, with "count" being treated as the ID parameter.
4. The `getPropertyById` method in `propertyController.js` tried to validate "count" as a MongoDB ID, which failed and resulted in a 500 error.

## Solution Implemented

We fixed the issue by changing the order of route registration in `server.js`:

```javascript
// Before
app.use('/api/properties', routes.propertyRoutes);
app.use('/api/properties/count', routes.propertyCountRoutes);

// After
app.use('/api/properties/count', routes.propertyCountRoutes);
app.use('/api/properties', routes.propertyRoutes);
```

By registering the more specific `/api/properties/count` route before the more general `/api/properties` route, we ensure that requests to `/api/properties/count` are handled by the correct route handler.

## Implementation Steps

1. Modified the `server.js` file to change the order of route registration.
2. Created a backup of the original file.
3. Restarted the server to apply the changes.

## Verification

After implementing the fix and restarting the server, the `/api/properties/count` endpoint now returns a 200 OK status code with the correct property count data:

```
GET /api/properties/count 200 120.574 ms - 27
```

## Lessons Learned

1. In Express.js, route order matters. More specific routes should be registered before more general routes.
2. When debugging API issues, check the route registration order in addition to the route handler implementation.
3. Always restart the server after making changes to route registration to ensure the changes take effect.

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement automated tests to verify that all API endpoints are correctly registered and functioning.
2. Consider using a more structured approach to route registration, such as using a router factory that automatically handles route order based on specificity.
3. Add more robust error handling in the frontend to gracefully handle API failures.
