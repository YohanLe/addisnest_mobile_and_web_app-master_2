# AddisnEst Property Submission Fixes

## Summary

This document outlines the fixes that have been applied to resolve the 500 error occurring during property submissions in the AddisnEst application.

## Problems Fixed

1. **Missing Async Middleware**: Added the missing async middleware to handle asynchronous route handlers.
2. **Property Controller Issues**: Updated the property controller to handle missing required fields.
3. **Route Configuration**: Replaced problematic nested controller with a working routes configuration.
4. **Address Field Validation**: Added support for both flat and nested address structures.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Missing Async Middleware

Created the missing `async.js` middleware which is used by the property controllers for error handling:

```javascript
// src/middleware/async.js
const asyncHandler = (fn) => (req, res, next) =>
  Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);

module.exports = asyncHandler;
```

### 2. Property Controller Fixes

Enhanced the property controller with two key methods:

- `ensureAddressFields()`: Ensures all required address fields are present
- `sanitizePropertyData()`: Validates and normalizes all required fields

These methods are called before creating a property to prevent validation errors.

### 3. Route Configuration Fix

Created a new property routes file that doesn't depend on the problematic nested controller:

```javascript
// src/routes/propertyRoutes-working.js
const express = require('express');
const { propertyController } = require('../controllers');
const { protect, authorize } = require('../middleware/auth');

const router = express.Router();

// Public routes
router.get('/', propertyController.getAllProperties);
router.get('/search', propertyController.searchProperties);
router.get('/featured', propertyController.getFeaturedProperties);
router.get('/mongo-id/:id', propertyController.getPropertyByMongoId);
router.get('/:id', propertyController.getPropertyById);
router.get('/user/:userId', propertyController.getPropertiesByUser);

// Protected routes (require authentication)
router.use(protect);
// Use the main controller with our fixes applied
router.post('/', authorize('agent', 'customer', 'admin'), propertyController.createProperty);
router.put('/:id', propertyController.updateProperty);
router.delete('/:id', propertyController.deleteProperty);
router.put('/:id/photos', propertyController.uploadPropertyPhotos);

module.exports = router;
```

And updated the routes index to use this working file:

```javascript
// Modified src/routes/index.js
const userRoutes = require('./userRoutes');
const authRoutes = require('./authRoutes');
// Use our fixed property routes implementation
const propertyRoutes = require('./propertyRoutes-working');
// ... rest of the file unchanged
```

### 4. Address Field Handling

The `ensureAddressFields` method in the property controller now handles different address formats:

- Flat address format (street, city, state, country as top-level fields)
- Nested address format (address object with street, city, state, country properties)
- Legacy formats (property_address, regional_state)

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. Start the application using the fixed launcher:
   ```
   node fixed-launcher.js
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/ in your browser

3. Log in and try to submit a property with the following test cases:
   - A property with all required fields
   - A property with missing address fields
   - A property with nested address structure

The application should now handle all these cases without 500 errors.

## Automated Startup Script

We've also created a convenient restart script that can be used to launch the application with all fixes applied:

```
node restart-app.js
```

This script will:
1. Kill any running server instances
2. Clear Node.js cache
3. Start the application with all fixes applied

## Backup and Recovery

The original property controller has been backed up to:
```
backups/propertyController.js.bak
```

If needed, you can restore the original controller from this backup.
