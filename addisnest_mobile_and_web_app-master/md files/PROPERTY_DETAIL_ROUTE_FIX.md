# Property Detail Route Fix

## Issue Fixed
Fixed method name mismatches in `propertyRoutes-mongo-id-fix.js` that were causing server startup errors.

## Changes Made
1. Changed route handler from `propertyController.getUserProperties` to `propertyController.getPropertiesByUser`
2. Changed route handler from `propertyController.getProperties` to `propertyController.getAllProperties`
3. Changed route handler from `propertyController.addProperty` to `propertyController.createProperty`

## Impact
- The server now starts successfully
- Property detail fetching is working correctly
- Fixed potential 500 errors when accessing property routes

## Verification
The server was successfully restarted and property details can now be properly retrieved. 
The terminal logs show successful API requests to property endpoints.

## Affected Files
- `src/routes/propertyRoutes-mongo-id-fix.js`
