# MongoDB ID Property Edit Fix

## Issue
When clicking on the Edit button from the account management page, the property edit form appeared blank, failing to fetch and display the property data. The root cause was that the property IDs in MongoDB format (24-character hex strings) were not being properly handled in the property edit workflow.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added MongoDB-specific Endpoint in EditPropertyForm.jsx

The property edit form now tries an additional API endpoint specifically designed for MongoDB IDs:

```javascript
const endpoints = [
    `agent/property/${propertyId}`,
    `properties/${propertyId}`,
    `property/${propertyId}`,
    `property/get/${propertyId}`,
    `property-by-id/${propertyId}`, 
    `properties/mongo-id/${propertyId}` // Added MongoDB-specific endpoint
];
```

This ensures that when a MongoDB ID is passed to the edit form, it can properly fetch the data using the appropriate endpoint.

### 2. Enhanced Property Data Storage in PropertyListingsTab.jsx

When clicking the Edit button in the property listings, the component now explicitly preserves the MongoDB ID:

```javascript
const normalizedProperty = {
    _id: item._id || item.id,
    id: item._id || item.id,
    propertyId: item._id || item.id,
    mongoId: item._id || item.id, // Added to ensure MongoDB ID is preserved
    // other property data...
};
```

This ensures that regardless of how the property data is stored or retrieved, the MongoDB ID format is maintained throughout the edit workflow.

## How to Test

1. Run the provided test script:
   ```
   start-property-edit-mongodb-test.bat
   ```

2. This script will:
   - Run test-mongodb-id-property-edit.js to set up test data
   - Start the backend server
   - Start the frontend development server

3. Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/property-edit/6849bd6a2b9f36399990f4fb

4. Verify that the form is populated with the test property data:
   - Property Type: House
   - Property For: For Sale
   - Price: 25000000
   - Bedrooms: 4
   - Bathrooms: 3
   - Address: 123 MongoDB Street, Addis Ababa

## Manual Testing from UI

1. Start the application normally
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Navigate to your account management page
4. Go to the "My Listings" tab
5. Click the "Edit" button on any property
6. Verify that the property data loads correctly in the edit form

## Technical Details

The fix ensures compatibility with both traditional numeric IDs and MongoDB's ObjectId format (24-character hexadecimal strings). The system now tries multiple endpoints and data sources to find the property data, with robust fallback mechanisms to ensure the edit form is always populated with the correct data.
