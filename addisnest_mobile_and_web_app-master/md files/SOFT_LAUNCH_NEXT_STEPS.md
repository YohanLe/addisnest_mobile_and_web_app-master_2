# Soft Launch Next Steps

Congratulations! I can see your deployment was successful, as shown by the "Complete" status for post-processing in the Netlify deployment log.

## Immediate Actions

Now that your site is deployed, you should:

1. **Set Up Password Protection**
   - Go to your site's Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to Site settings > Access control
   - Enable password protection and create a password for your soft launch testers

2. **Verify Your Deployment**
   - Visit your new Netlify URL to confirm everything is working correctly
   - Test critical functionality in the password-protected environment
   - Check that your API connection is working properly

3. **Prepare for User Testing**
   - Use the templates in USER_INVITATION_TEMPLATE.md to invite your initial test group (5-10 users)
   - Include the Netlify URL and password in your invitations
   - Set up a feedback collection method (Google Forms, email, etc.)

## Monitoring During Soft Launch

During the soft launch period, regularly:

1. **Check Netlify Analytics**
   - Monitor site usage patterns
   - Look for any performance issues or errors

2. **Collect and Analyze Feedback**
   - Organize feedback by category (UX, functionality, content, etc.)
   - Identify critical issues that need immediate attention
   - Document feature requests for future development

3. **Implement Improvements**
   - Deploy fixes for critical issues
   - Update your soft launch testers on changes made
   - Monitor how changes affect user behavior

## Expanding to Full Launch

After 2-3 weeks of soft launch testing:

1. **Evaluate Readiness**
   - Review all collected feedback
   - Ensure all critical issues have been resolved
   - Confirm site performance meets expectations

2. **Plan Marketing and Announcement**
   - Prepare announcement materials for full launch
   - Set a specific date for removing password protection
   - Create content for social media and other channels

3. **Transition to Public Access**
   - Remove password protection in Netlify dashboard
   - Announce the full launch to stakeholders
