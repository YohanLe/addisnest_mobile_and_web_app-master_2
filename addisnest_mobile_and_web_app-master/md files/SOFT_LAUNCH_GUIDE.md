# Soft Launch Strategy for addisnest.com

This guide outlines the steps to perform a soft launch of addisnest.com, allowing you to test the platform with limited users before a full public launch.

## What is a Soft Launch?

A soft launch is a strategic approach to releasing your website to a limited audience before the full public launch. This allows you to:
- Test functionality in a real-world environment
- Gather feedback from select users
- Identify and fix issues without widespread impact
- Gradually scale up infrastructure and support systems

## Soft Launch Plan for addisnest.com

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch Preparation (1-2 weeks before soft launch)

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Review and finalize `.env.production` settings
   - Ensure the API endpoint (currently set to `https://addinest-api-demo.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api`) is ready

2. **Deployment Testing**
   - Deploy to a staging environment first:
     ```
     netlify deploy
     ```
     This creates a draft URL for testing before going live.

3. **Create a Pre-Launch Checklist**
   - User account creation/login functionality
   - Property listing creation and editing
   - Search functionality
   - Image uploads and display
   - Contact forms and messaging
   - Mobile responsiveness

### Phase 2: Initial Deployment (Soft Launch Day)

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - Run the deployment script:
     ```
     deploy-to-netlify.bat
     ```
   - Confirm "dist" as the publish directory when prompted

2. **Set Up Domain with Limited Access**
   - Add the custom domain in Netlify dashboard but consider these options:
     - Option A: Use a subdomain for soft launch (e.g., beta.addisnest.com)
     - Option B: Use password protection for the main domain
     
   To add password protection in Netlify:
   - Go to Site settings > Access control > Password protection
   - Enable and set a password

3. **Monitor Initial Deployment**
   - Check Netlify deployment logs
   - Verify all site functionality works as expected
   - Confirm API connections are functioning properly

### Phase 3: Limited User Testing (1-2 weeks)

1. **Invite Select Users**
   - Prepare an email invitation with:
     - Access instructions (URL and password if applicable)
     - Brief explanation of the platform
     - Specific feedback areas you're looking for
     - How to report issues

2. **Gather Feedback Systematically**
   - Set up a feedback form (Google Forms, Typeform, etc.)
   - Create a private Slack channel or Discord server for testers
   - Schedule individual feedback sessions with key users

3. **Monitor and Iterate**
   - Review Netlify analytics for usage patterns
   - Address critical bugs immediately
   - Document feature requests for later consideration
   - Make incremental improvements based on feedback

### Phase 4: Scaling Up (1-2 weeks)

1. **Expand User Base Gradually**
   - Increase the number of invited users incrementally
   - Monitor performance with increased load
   - Continue collecting and implementing feedback

2. **Prepare for Full Launch**
   - Finalize any remaining features or improvements
   - Develop a marketing communication plan
   - Prepare support resources and documentation
   - Set up analytics tracking for full launch metrics

3. **Plan for Transition to Public Access**
   - If using password protection, schedule when to remove it
   - If using a subdomain, plan the migration to the main domain
   - Prepare announcement for the full public launch

### Phase 5: Full Launch Transition

1. **Remove Access Restrictions**
   - Disable password protection in Netlify dashboard
   - Or redirect from beta subdomain to main domain

2. **Announce Full Availability**
   - Send email announcements to all stakeholders
   - Update social media profiles and other web properties
   - Consider a press release for the real estate community

   - Consider additional tools like Google PageSpeed Insights

## Common Soft Launch Issues and Solutions

1. **Unexpected Functionality Issues**

2. What issues were discovered?
3. How quickly were problems resolved?
4. What feedback patterns emerged?
5. What changes should be made before full launch?

This evaluation will help ensure your full public launch goes smoothly.
