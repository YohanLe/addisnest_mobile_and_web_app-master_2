# Property Count API Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

After successful OTP verification and user login, the application was encountering a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to fetch property count data from the `/api/properties/count` endpoint. This error was occurring because the endpoint was not properly registered in the server configuration.

The error appeared in the console as:
```
GET http://localhost:5194/api/properties/count 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error fetching property count: AxiosError {message: 'Request failed with status code 500', name: 'AxiosError', code: 'ERR_BAD_RESPONSE', ...}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The property count route (`propertyCountRoutes`) was correctly defined in `src/routes/propertyCountRoutes.js` and imported in `src/routes/index.js`.
2. However, the route was not actually mounted in the Express application in `src/server.js`.
3. When the frontend attempted to fetch property count data after login (in `PropertyListPage.jsx`), the request failed with a 500 error because the endpoint didn't exist.

## Solution Implemented

We added the missing route registration in `src/server.js`:

```javascript
// Before
app.use('/api/properties', routes.propertyRoutes);
app.use('/api/property-submit', routes.propertySubmitRoute);
app.use('/api/conversations', routes.conversationRoutes);

// After
app.use('/api/properties', routes.propertyRoutes);
app.use('/api/properties/count', routes.propertyCountRoutes);
app.use('/api/property-submit', routes.propertySubmitRoute);
app.use('/api/conversations', routes.conversationRoutes);
```

This change properly registers the property count endpoint, allowing the frontend to successfully fetch property count data after login.

## Affected Components

1. **PropertyListPage.jsx**: This component makes an API call to fetch the total property count using the `/api/properties/count` endpoint.
2. **HomePage.jsx**: This component uses PropertyListPage and would be indirectly affected by the property count API error.

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Start the application server
2. Register or login as a customer
3. After successful login, the application should load the home page without any 500 errors
4. The property count should be displayed correctly in the property listings section

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement more robust error handling in the frontend to gracefully handle API failures
2. Add automated tests to verify that all API endpoints are correctly registered and functioning
3. Consider implementing a health check endpoint that can verify all critical API endpoints are available
