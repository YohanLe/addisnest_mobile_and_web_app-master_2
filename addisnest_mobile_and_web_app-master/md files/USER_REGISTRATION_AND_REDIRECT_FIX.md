# User Registration and Redirect Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the user registration process and ensure proper redirection to the home page after successful login or registration.

## Issues Fixed

1. **User Registration Data Storage**: Fixed issues with saving user data to MongoDB during registration.
2. **Home Page Redirection**: Ensured consistent redirection to the home page after successful authentication.
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for OTP verification failures.

## Changes Made

### Client-Side Changes

1. **OtpPopup.jsx**:
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages based on HTTP status codes
   - Added a fallback redirection mechanism for registration flows when server errors occur
   - Fixed field name mismatches between client and server:
     - Used `specialties` instead of `specialization` to match the User model
     - Added `region` field to match the User model
     - Ensured `isVerified` is set to true for new registrations
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

2. **SigninPage.jsx**:
   - Replaced `navigate('/')` with `window.location.href = '/'` for more reliable redirection
   - This ensures a full page reload and proper state reset after login

### Server-Side Changes

1. **userController.js**:
   - Fixed field name mismatches in the `verifyOTP` function:
     - Used `specialties` instead of `specialization` to match the User model
     - Added `region` field to match the User model
   - Added detailed logging for debugging
   - Ensured `isVerified` is set to true for new registrations

## Testing

A test script has been created to verify the registration process and confirm that user data is correctly saved to MongoDB:

1. **test-user-registration.js**: Tests the full registration flow from OTP request to user creation
2. **run-user-registration-test.bat**: Batch file to run the test script

## How to Test

1. Run the application with `npm run dev` or your standard startup command
2. Execute the test script by running `run-user-registration-test.bat`
3. The script will:
   - Create a test user with a unique email
   - Request an OTP for the test user
   - Verify the OTP and register the user
   - Check if the user was successfully saved to MongoDB
   - Output the results of each step

## Manual Testing

You can also test the fix manually:

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Click on "Register" to open the registration form
3. Fill in the required fields and submit
4. Enter the OTP sent to your email (or shown in the console in development mode)
5. Verify that you are redirected to the home page after successful registration
6. Check MongoDB to confirm that the user data was saved correctly

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that users are consistently redirected to the home page after successful authentication in all flows (direct login, OTP verification, registration). The improved error handling provides better user feedback when issues occur, and the field name fixes ensure that user data is correctly saved to MongoDB.
