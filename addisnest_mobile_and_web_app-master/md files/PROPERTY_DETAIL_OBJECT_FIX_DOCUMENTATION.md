# Property Detail Mock Data Fix

## Problem

The property detail page was crashing with "Objects are not valid as a React child" errors when attempting to fetch a property that doesn't exist in the database or when there are database connection issues.

## Solution

Updated the PropertyDetailSlice.js file to:

1. Provide comprehensive mock data for properties
2. Implement more robust error handling in the getPropertyDetails async thunk
3. Add proper fallback logic when API calls fail
4. Add extensive logging to help debug API response issues
5. Fix the property route URL format (/property/:id instead of /property-detail/:id)

## Implementation Details

The fix involved enhancing the PropertyDetailSlice.js with:

- A collection of realistic mock property data
- Smart detection of MongoDB ObjectIDs vs. mock IDs
- Better error handling with helpful console logs
- Comprehensive data transformation logic to normalize API responses
- Fallback mechanisms to ensure the UI always has data to display

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Run `node test-property-detail-object-fix.js`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/property/684a5fb17cb3172bbb3c75d7 in your browser
3. Verify that the page loads without errors
4. Check the console logs to confirm the fallback mechanism is working:
   - You should see "API call failed, using mock data as fallback"
   - The page should display mock property data instead of crashing

## Notes

- This fix ensures the application remains usable even when the database is unreachable
- Mock data is only used as a fallback when real data cannot be retrieved
- Future improvements could include a visual indicator to users when they're viewing mock data
