# How to Test Property Features Implementation

This guide explains how to test the property features implementation in the Addinest property detail page.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have:

1. Node.js installed on your system
2. The Addinest application running locally:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend: http://localhost:7001
3. Test property data with features in your database

## Testing Options

There are two ways to test the property features implementation:

### Option 1: Using the Automated Test Script

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window
2. Navigate to the project root directory
3. Run the test batch file:
   ```
   run-property-features-test.bat
   ```
4. The test will:
   - Launch a browser window
   - Navigate to a property detail page with features
   - Verify that the features section exists
   - Check if all expected features are displayed correctly
   - Take a screenshot for reference
   - Close the browser when complete

### Option 2: Manual Testing

1. Start the Addinest application using:
   ```
   node restart-app.js
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5173

3. Browse to a property detail page by:
   - Clicking on any property from the homepage OR
   - Navigating directly to: http://localhost:5173/property/6849cce57cb3172bbb3c70b3

4. Verify the following:
   - The "Property Features" section is visible on the property detail page
   - Features like "Parking Space", "Garage", "24/7 Security", etc. are displayed
   - Each feature has an appropriate icon
   - The layout is responsive and properly formatted

## Expected Results

When viewing a property with features, you should see:

1. A clearly labeled "Property Features" section
2. Features displayed in a grid layout
3. Each feature with an appropriate icon/emoji
4. Features displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., "Parking Space" instead of "parking-space")

## Troubleshooting

If features are not displaying correctly:

1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Verify the property data has a `features` object with boolean values
3. Check if the property detail component is correctly rendering the features section
4. Ensure CSS styles for the features section are properly loaded

## Additional Notes

- The current implementation supports six features: Parking Space, Garage, 24/7 Security, CCTV Surveillance, Gym/Fitness Center, and Swimming Pool
- The features grid is responsive and will adjust based on screen size
- The implementation handles cases where a property may not have any features defined
