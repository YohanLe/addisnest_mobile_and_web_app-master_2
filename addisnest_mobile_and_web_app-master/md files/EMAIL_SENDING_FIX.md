# Email Sending Fix Documentation

## Issue
The OTP (One-Time Password) email sending functionality was not working properly. Users were not receiving OTP emails during login or registration, even though the OTP verification process was working correctly and users were being added to the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified in the environment configuration. The `.env` file was missing the required SendGrid API key (`SENDGRID_API_KEY`) and sender email (`EMAIL_FROM`) variables that are necessary for the email service to function properly.

## Fix Implemented
1. Added the missing environment variables to the `.env` file:
   ```
   # Email Configuration (SendGrid)
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
   EMAIL_FROM=contact@addisnest.com
   ```

2. Created a server restart script (`restart-server-with-email-fix.js`) to apply the changes.

3. Created a batch file (`run-server-with-email-fix.bat`) for easy execution of the restart script.

## How to Complete the Fix
To fully implement the fix, you need to:

1. Replace the placeholder SendGrid API key with your actual SendGrid API key:
   - Open the `.env` file
   - Replace `your_sendgrid_api_key_here` with your actual SendGrid API key
   - Save the file

2. Restart the server to apply the changes:
   - Run the `run-server-with-email-fix.bat` batch file
   - Or execute `node restart-server-with-email-fix.js` directly

## Verification
After implementing the fix, you can verify that the email sending functionality is working properly by:

1. Attempting to register a new user or log in with an existing user
2. Checking if the OTP email is received
3. Verifying that the OTP verification process works correctly

## Additional Notes
- The email service is configured to use SendGrid as the email provider
- In development mode, the system will continue to function even if email sending fails, but in production, it will throw an error
- The OTP emails are sent with a styled HTML template that includes the AddisNest branding
