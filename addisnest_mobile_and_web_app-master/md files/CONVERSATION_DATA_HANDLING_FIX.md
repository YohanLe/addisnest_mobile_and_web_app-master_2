# Conversation Data Handling Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing an error when trying to load conversations in both the web and mobile interfaces:

```
Error fetching conversations: TypeError: data.map is not a function
    at fetchConversations (Messages.jsx:198:45)
```

```
Error fetching conversations: TypeError: data.map is not a function
    at fetchConversations (MobileChatInterface.jsx:180:45)
```

This error occurred because the frontend components were expecting the API response to be an array directly, but the API was returning an object with a nested `data` property containing the array of conversations.

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/account-management/sub-component/account-tab/Messages.jsx`
2. `src/components/account-management/sub-component/account-tab/MobileChatInterface.jsx`

## Solution

The solution was to modify the data handling in both components to check if the response data is an array or if it has a `data` property, and then use the appropriate structure for mapping:

```javascript
// Before
const data = await response.json();
const formattedConversations = data.map(conv => {
  // ...
});

// After
const data = await response.json();
// Check if data is an array or has a data property
const conversationsArray = Array.isArray(data) ? data : (data.data || []);
const formattedConversations = conversationsArray.map(conv => {
  // ...
});
```

This ensures that we're always mapping over an array, regardless of whether the API returns an array directly or an object with a nested data array.

## Testing

The fix was tested by restarting the server and verifying that the conversations load correctly in both the web and mobile interfaces. The error "TypeError: data.map is not a function" no longer appears in the console.
