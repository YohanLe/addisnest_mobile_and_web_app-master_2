# Homepage Properties Display Fix

## Issue
The homepage is not displaying any properties even though there are properties in the database. Console logs show:

```
HomePage component mounted
HomeData in HomePage: {data: null, pending: false, error: null}
App.jsx:33 App component mounted
HomeSlice.js:12 Fetching all properties for home page, not filtering by featured status
FeaturedProperties.jsx:16 HomeData received in FeaturedProperties: {count: 0, pagination: {â€¦}, data: Array(0)}
```

This indicates that the HomeSlice is successfully making API requests, but no properties are being returned.

## Root Causes

1. **API Configuration**: There might be a mismatch between the API base URL configured in the frontend and the actual running backend server.

2. **Database Connection**: The application might not be connecting to the correct MongoDB database, or the database may not contain any properties.

3. **Request Parameters**: The API requests in HomeSlice.js may be using incorrect parameters, causing no results to be returned.

4. **Featured Property Filtering**: The HomeSlice.js and property controller may be inconsistently handling the 'featured' property filter.

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Enhanced Debugging in Components**:
   - Added more detailed logging in HomePage component
   - Added more detailed logging in FeaturedProperties component
   - Added more detailed logging in HomeSlice Redux module

2. **API Request Optimization**:
   - Modified HomeSlice.js to remove unnecessary type filtering when fetching all properties
   - Added enhanced logging of API requests and responses

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Updated the section title in FeaturedProperties component to "All Properties"
   - Improved error handling and empty state display

4. **Configuration Consistency**:
   - Created a launcher script that ensures consistent environment variables

## How to Test

1. Run the application using the fixed launcher script:
   ```
   node fixed-homepage-properties-launcher.js
   ```

2. Check the browser console for debug information and API responses

3. Verify that properties are displayed on the homepage
