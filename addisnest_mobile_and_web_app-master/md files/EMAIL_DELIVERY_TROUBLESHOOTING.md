# Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue
While the OTP (One-Time Password) email sending functionality is working correctly on the server side (SendGrid API is responding with a 202 status code), users are not receiving the OTP emails in their inbox.

## Diagnosis
Based on our testing and server logs, we've confirmed:

1. The SendGrid API key is valid and properly configured in the `.env` file
2. The server is successfully calling the SendGrid API to send emails
3. SendGrid is accepting the emails for delivery (202 status code)
4. The OTP generation and verification process is working correctly
5. The test scripts are able to retrieve and verify OTPs

However, the emails are not being delivered to the users' inboxes.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

### 1. SendGrid Account Restrictions
**Possible Issue**: Your SendGrid account might be in a sandbox or trial mode, which restricts email delivery to verified email addresses only.

**Solution**:
- Log in to your SendGrid account and check if it's in a sandbox or trial mode
- If it is, you'll need to verify the recipient email addresses or upgrade to a paid plan
- In the SendGrid dashboard, go to "Settings" > "Sender Authentication" to verify your sender domain and email addresses

### 2. Emails Going to Spam Folder
**Possible Issue**: The emails are being delivered but are being filtered into the spam/junk folder.

**Solution**:
- Ask users to check their spam/junk folders
- Improve email deliverability by:
  - Setting up proper SPF and DKIM records for your domain
  - Using a consistent sender email address
  - Avoiding spam trigger words in your email content
  - Including a clear unsubscribe option

### 3. Sender Email Verification
**Possible Issue**: The sender email (contact@addisnest.com) might not be verified in the SendGrid account.

**Solution**:
- Log in to your SendGrid account
- Go to "Settings" > "Sender Authentication"
- Verify the sender email address (contact@addisnest.com)
- If you don't own the domain, you might need to use a different sender email that you can verify

### 4. Domain Authentication
**Possible Issue**: The sender domain (addisnest.com) might not be properly authenticated in SendGrid.

**Solution**:
- Log in to your SendGrid account
- Go to "Settings" > "Sender Authentication"
- Set up domain authentication for addisnest.com
- Follow the instructions to add the necessary DNS records (SPF, DKIM, CNAME)

### 5. SendGrid API Permissions
**Possible Issue**: The SendGrid API key might not have the necessary permissions to send emails.

**Solution**:
- Log in to your SendGrid account
- Go to "Settings" > "API Keys"
- Check the permissions for your API key
- Ensure it has "Mail Send" permissions
- If needed, create a new API key with the necessary permissions

### 6. Email Content Issues
**Possible Issue**: The email content might be triggering spam filters.

**Solution**:
- Review the email template in `src/utils/emailService.js`
- Avoid using excessive capitalization, exclamation marks, or spam trigger words
- Ensure the HTML is properly formatted
- Test the email content with a spam filter testing tool

## Immediate Workaround
While you're resolving the email delivery issues, you can implement a workaround to ensure users can still use the OTP functionality:

1. In development mode, the OTP is already displayed in the server logs and returned in the API response
2. For production, you could temporarily add a feature to display the OTP on the frontend (only during this troubleshooting period)
3. Add a note to users explaining that they should receive an email, but if they don't, they can use the displayed OTP

## Testing Email Delivery
To test if your fixes have resolved the email delivery issues:

1. Use a service like [Mail Tester](https://www.mail-tester.com/) to check your email deliverability score
2. Send test emails to different email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
3. Check the SendGrid Activity Feed to see the status of your sent emails

## Long-term Recommendations
To ensure reliable email delivery in the future:

1. Consider using a dedicated email service provider for transactional emails
2. Set up proper email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
3. Monitor your email deliverability and spam complaints
4. Implement email templates that follow best practices for deliverability
5. Consider adding alternative notification methods (SMS, in-app notifications)
