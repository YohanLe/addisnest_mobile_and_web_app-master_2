# Buy/Rent Toggle Button Implementation in Header

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a combined Buy/Rent toggle button in the site's main navigation header. The feature enhances user experience by allowing users to quickly switch between viewing properties for sale and properties for rent with a single button.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Changes

The primary changes were made to the `Header.jsx` component:

- Added a new state variable `buyRentToggle` to track the current toggle state (buy or rent)
- Created a new toggle button that replaces the separate Buy and Rent buttons
- Implemented visual styling to clearly indicate the current toggle state
- Added immediate search functionality upon toggle state change

### 2. Property Listing Page Updates

Additionally, we made the following changes to the `PropertyListPage.jsx` component:

- Removed the redundant Offering Type filter since it's now handled in the header navigation
- Removed the search box and implemented a filter-based search approach
- Moved the "Apply Filters" button inside the filters box for better UX
- Improved the filter section layout for a cleaner, more intuitive design

### 2. Functionality

The Buy/Rent toggle button works as follows:

- The button displays both "Buy/Rent" text and a small indicator showing the current state
- When clicked, it toggles between "Buy" and "Rent" modes
- In "Buy" mode, clicking the button navigates to the property listing page showing properties for sale
- In "Rent" mode, clicking the button navigates to the property listing page showing properties for rent
- The button is visually styled to make the current state obvious to users

### 3. API Integration

The toggle button interacts with the existing API endpoints through:

- The `handleSearch` function, which constructs the appropriate URL based on the toggle state
- For "Buy" mode: Uses the `for=sale` parameter to fetch properties for sale
- For "Rent" mode: Uses the `for=rent` parameter to fetch properties for rent

## Visual Design

The toggle button features:

- Larger, more prominent "Buy/Rent" text label (16px font size)
- Bold text with increased padding for better visibility
- A pill-shaped indicator showing the current mode ("Buy" or "Rent")
- Color coding to distinguish between modes (red for Buy, blue for Rent)
- Responsive design that works across different screen sizes
- Increased size overall for better usability

## Testing

A test script (`test-buy-rent-toggle.js`) and batch file (`run-buy-rent-toggle-test.bat`) have been provided to help test this functionality:

1. Run the `run-buy-rent-toggle-test.bat` batch file
2. Follow the instructions provided in the console
3. Verify that the toggle button:
   - Properly displays the current state
   - Changes state when clicked
   - Navigates to the correct property listings when used

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

- Adding animations for the toggle state transition
- Persisting the user's preferred toggle state across sessions
- Adding keyboard shortcuts for toggle operation
- Expanding the toggle to include additional property types
