# OTP Endpoint Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

The application was experiencing connection errors when trying to request OTP codes. The error was occurring because the frontend was using an incorrect endpoint:

- **Incorrect endpoint used:** `auth/send-otp`
- **Correct endpoint:** `auth/request-otp`

The backend routes in `src/routes/authRoutes.js` define endpoints for `request-otp` and `resend-otp`, but there was no endpoint for `send-otp`. This mismatch was causing the connection errors.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `src/helper/EmailVerificationPopup.jsx` to use the correct endpoint:
   ```javascript
   // Changed from:
   const response = await Api.post("auth/send-otp", { 
       email,
       provider // 'google' or 'apple'
   });

   // To:
   const response = await Api.post("auth/request-otp", { 
       email,
       provider // 'google' or 'apple'
   });
   ```

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Using the Web Interface

1. Start the backend server: `node restart-server-clean.js`
2. Start the frontend server: `.\run-frontend-fixed.bat`
3. Navigate to the application in your browser: `http://localhost:5179/`
4. Try to log in or register, which will trigger the OTP flow
5. When prompted for an OTP, check the server console logs for the OTP code
6. Enter the OTP code from the console logs into the verification form

### Method 2: Using the Test Script

1. Make sure the backend server is running: `node restart-server-clean.js`
2. Run the test script: `.\run-otp-fix-test.bat`
3. Check the output to confirm that the request to the `auth/request-otp` endpoint is successful
4. Check the server console logs for the OTP code

## Important Notes

- In development mode, the application simulates email sending rather than actually sending emails.
- The OTP code is displayed in the server console logs rather than being sent to your actual email address.
- Look for a log message like this in the server console:
  ```
  ==================================================
  DEVELOPMENT OTP CODE: 388632
  ==================================================
  âœ… OTP email sent to yohanb1212@gmail.com
  ```
- Use the code displayed (in this example, `388632`) in the OTP verification form.

## Files Created for Testing and Documentation

1. `OTP_DEVELOPMENT_MODE_GUIDE.md` - Explains how OTP works in development mode
2. `test-otp-fix.js` - Script to test the OTP functionality
3. `run-otp-fix-test.bat` - Batch file to run the test script
4. `OTP_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps

If you need to deploy this fix to production, make sure to:

1. Test the fix thoroughly in a staging environment
2. Configure the email service (e.g., SendGrid) to actually send emails in production
3. Update any other files that might be using the incorrect endpoint (none were found in this codebase)
