# Netlify API 404 Error Fixes

## Problem

The application was experiencing 404 errors when making API requests to fetch property listings on the Netlify-hosted site:

```
addisnesttest.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api/properties?for=buy&page=1&limit=50&search=&priceRange=any&propertyType=all&bedrooms=any&bathrooms=any&regionalState=all&sortBy=newest&offeringType=For+Sale:1 
        
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

This was causing the homepage to fail to load property listings and displaying errors in the console.

## Root Cause

The issue stemmed from how Netlify serverless functions are structured and accessed:

1. The frontend was making API requests to `/.netlify/functions/api/properties`, but Netlify functions don't natively support this nested routing pattern.
2. The `api.js` serverless function was set up to handle API routes, but it wasn't properly receiving the `/properties` requests due to how Netlify's function routing works.
3. The API routes in Netlify functions need to be set up as separate functions or with proper redirect rules.

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive fix with the following components:

### 1. Created a Dedicated Properties Function

We added a new Netlify serverless function (`functions/properties.js`) that specifically handles property-related requests. This function:

- Connects to MongoDB
- Provides endpoints for fetching property listings with filtering options
- Handles requests for individual properties by ID
- Properly formats the response to match the expected format by the frontend

### 2. Updated the Redirect Rules

We modified the `_redirects` file to properly route requests to the new properties function:

```
# Handle properties routes directly
/.netlify/functions/properties /.netlify/functions/properties 200
/.netlify/functions/properties/* /.netlify/functions/properties/:splat 200
```

### 3. Created a Netlify API Handler Utility

We created a utility module (`src/utils/netlifyApiHandler.js`) that:

- Correctly constructs API URLs for both local development and Netlify environments
- Automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate URL pattern
- Provides dedicated methods for fetching properties and property details
- Handles the necessary transformations between frontend requests and API expectations
- Maintains backward compatibility with the local development server

### 4. Updated Redux Store Actions

We modified the Redux store slices (`HomeSlice.js` and `PropertyDetailSlice.js`) to:

- Use the new netlifyApiHandler utility instead of direct API calls
- Properly handle responses from the new properties function
- Maintain the same data flow and state management patterns

## How to Deploy the Fix

A deployment script has been created to easily deploy these fixes to Netlify:

1. Run the `deploy-netlify-api-fixes.bat` script, which will:
   - Build the project
   - Deploy to Netlify with the API fixes

## Verification

After deployment, the property listings should load correctly on the homepage without 404 errors. You can verify this by:

1. Checking the browser console for any errors
2. Confirming that property listings appear on the homepage
3. Verifying that property detail pages load correctly
4. Checking the Netlify function logs for any remaining issues

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues after deploying the fix:

1. Check the Netlify function logs in the Netlify dashboard
2. Verify that your MongoDB connection is working (check the connection string in environment variables)
3. Ensure that all environment variables are properly set in the Netlify dashboard
4. Test the API locally using Netlify CLI's dev environment before deployment

## Environment Compatibility

This solution is designed to work in both local development and Netlify production environments:

### Local Development
- The API handler detects when running locally and uses the standard API routes
- No changes to your local development workflow are needed
- All API requests are directed to `http://localhost:7000/api/properties` as before

### Netlify Production
- The API handler detects the Netlify environment and routes property requests to the dedicated properties function
- Other API requests continue to go through the main API function
- This provides a seamless experience across environments while fixing the 404 errors on Netlify
