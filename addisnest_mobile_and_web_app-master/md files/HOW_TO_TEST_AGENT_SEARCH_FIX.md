# How to Test the Agent Search Fix

This guide will help you verify that the agent search feature is working correctly after applying the fixes.

## Background

The agent search feature was previously returning "0 Agents Available" despite having agents in the database. This was due to:

1. Field name mismatches between the frontend component and the API response
2. Syntax errors in the JSX code for rendering agent specialties and languages
3. Missing agent data in the database

## Prerequisites

Before running the test, ensure that:

1. The MongoDB database is running
2. The backend server is running (`node src/server.js`)
3. The frontend development server is running (`npm run dev --prefix src`)

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Run the Database Update Script

First, update the agent data in the database:

```bash
node direct-update-agent.js
```

Or use our simplified test script:

```bash
node test-agent-search-simple.js
```

This will update the agent record with the correct fields:
- specialties: ['Buying', 'Selling', 'Residential']
- languagesSpoken: ['Amharic', 'English']
- averageRating: 4.5
- region: 'Addis Ababa'
- isVerified: true
- firstName and lastName set correctly

### Step 2: Verify Frontend Component Updates

The FindAgentList component has been updated to:
- Use `agent.languagesSpoken` instead of `agent.languages`
- Use `agent.firstName` and `agent.lastName` instead of `agent.name`
- Use `agent.averageRating` instead of `agent.rating`
- Fix syntax errors in the rendering of specialties and languages arrays

### Step 3: Test the Agent Search Functionality

1. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/find-agent/list
   ```

2. Verify that:
   - At least one agent is displayed in the list
   - The agent's name appears correctly (first and last name)
   - The agent's specialties are displayed correctly
   - The agent's languages are displayed correctly
   - The agent's rating (stars) is displayed correctly
   - The verified badge appears if the agent is verified

3. Try filtering agents using the provided filters to ensure they work correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you still see "0 Agents Available" or encounter other issues:

1. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify that the backend API is returning agent data by visiting:
   ```
   http://localhost:7000/api/agents/list
   ```
3. Check if the MongoDB connection is working properly
4. Ensure all frontend components are properly updated and the syntax is correct

## Applied Fixes

1. Created `direct-update-agent.js` to update agent data in the database
2. Created `fix-agent-search.js` to update field references in the FindAgentList component
3. Created `fix-agent-search-syntax.js` to fix syntax errors in the JSX code
4. Added documentation in `AGENT_SEARCH_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md`
